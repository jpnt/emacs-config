# emacs-config

This is my personal Emacs configuration, optimized for my workflow and preferences.
It is not meant to be a general-purpose configuration, but rather one that emphasizes
simplicity, speed, and minimalism while using the latest Emacs features.

Key features:

- **Fast startup**: Using early-init.el and streamlining the package setup.
- **e(vi)l mode**: For vi/vim-style keybindings.
- **Minimal plugins**: To keep the setup lightweight and maintainable over the years.
- **No org-mode**: I donâ€™t like it.
- **Alternative to eglot**: I use `lspce` for LSP support, as it requires less 
  configuration and is more minimalistic.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zbelial/lspce ~/.emacs.d/lspce --depth=1
git clone https://github.com/jpnt/emacs-config $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/emacs --depth=1
```

## Goals

- **Minimal Configuration**: Less is more. Less configuration == better.
- **Ease of Modification**: The `init.el` should be easy to understand and modify,
  even for those unfamiliar with Emacs Lisp.
- **Fast and Lightweight**: Emacs should run efficiently on (almost) any machine. Fast startup time.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Reduce friction, allowing for fast operations without
  plugins or configurations getting in the way.
- **Basic IDE Features**: Includes Git integration (`magit`), file explorer (`dired`),
  auto-completion (`company`), and language server protocol (via `lspce`).
