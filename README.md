# emacs-config

This is my personal emacs config. This is what I find works best for me.
So, naturally, it is not going to work well for everyone, it is not a general configuration.

# Goals

- Reduce as much configuration as possible. Less configuration == better.
- Extremely simple to modify init.el (configuration file). Even if you don't know Emacs Lisp.
- Fast and lightweight, I want emacs to run pretty much on any machine I get my hands on.
- Reduce as much drag as possible, I want to things as quickly as possible without plugins getting on the way.
- Get basic IDE features such as Git integration (magit), file explorer (dired), auto-complete (company) with lsp (eglot).
